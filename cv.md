### About myself
I decided to switch my life to the IT branch (which seems like a Git process). I have different experiences and I strongly believe that the most valuable background that I got at my previous job could be described in a few sentences:
- people are more important than things;
- «to be part of the team» is not just the words;
- do not be like Nokia (look at Actions NOKIA in the stock market);

I like to learn quickly and use it in practice as soon as possible. My dream is creating usefull, carefull and design app.
